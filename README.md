# UFOs

## Overview
Dana, a Data Journalist, wants to use Javascript to build a webpage where she can publish her UFO article and display UFO sightings inclusive of filters to search for sightings across the country. In this deliverable, primarily using javascript, a webpage will be customized and will include a table created to populate, and dynamically filter UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. 


### Data environment:

This webpage is impressive for Dana's very first time. It's equipped with an entry-based 5 filter search option, providing the UFO-enthusiasts with multiple options to view or search for UFO-sightings. To use the Filter Table, at least one option has to be entered. 

- Option 1: Sightings can be searched by “Date”. The date format has to be in a “MM/DD/YYYY”. 
- Option 2: Sightings can be filtered by “Location”-either by City, by State, or Both. The entry boxes are case sensitive. Only Lower-case entries are permitted.
- Option 3: Sightings can be search for by “shape”.  Customers must know the exact shape as it pertains to the sighting to use this criteria. 
- Option 4: The data from the table can be viewed in its totality shown from the initial Landing page. Customers can scroll up and down to see all the sighting information in it's entirety.

## Summary 

This web page is impressive for a data journalist’s first HTML project. The webpage is fully functional and interactive, It’s equipped with a search table with a variety options to filter from. You can use multiple filters or a single filter to view any of the of UFO sighting. However, There are a few drawbacks to the webpage: 

- The columns headers can not be filtered by Ascending/descending order, Viewers may need to organized the filtered information in a chronlogical order, alphabetical order.
- You can’t just filter by just year it has to be a full “mm/dd/yyyy” entry. Viewers may want to do research for a particular year or month.

- The webpage doesn't identify apostrophes and commas. The “comments” section of the HTML table has typos.

 For future development, I would advise:
- To color the “Filter Table” button a color that contrasts the background. 
- The webpage is blank and boring, add some additional customizations like visualizations or motion pictures. 
- Have a message that returns when “0 results found”. 
- The shape filter entry box should have a drop-down of shape options so viewers are aware of all the types of shapes they can choose from like “fireball”.
- Have Dana’s article in a smaller section of the webpage and have a larger section of the webpage update with the latest “UFO sighting”  article that has a VISUAL.
